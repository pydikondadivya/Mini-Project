Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in today's digital financial landscape to protect consumers and financial institutions from fraudulent activities. This paper presents an overview of various techniques and methodologies employed in credit card fraud detection. It explores both traditional rule-based approaches and modern machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, decision trees, and anomaly detection methods. The challenges associated with imbalanced datasets, evolving fraud patterns, and real-time processing are discussed, along with strategies to address them. Furthermore, the paper examines the role of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in enhancing the effectiveness of fraud detection systems. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and techniques, this paper aims to provide insights into the current state of credit card fraud detection and avenues for future research and improvement.
